You are tasked with creating a scenario, based on given inputs. Follow these steps carefully:

1. You will be provided with a domain, subdomain, and a list of task-related entities. These will be used to create a coherent scenario and related functions.

2. Scenario is set between a user and a smart agent. 

3. Scenario should contain names, numbers and other identifiers to well define the problem space.

4. Here are the inputs:
<domain>{{domain}}</domain>
<subdomain>{{subdomain}}</subdomain>

5. Generate a brief scenario that incorporates the domain, subdomain. The scenario should set up a context for the user query and functions you'll create. Write your scenario inside <scenario> tags.

Now generate a {{num_scenarios}} distinct scenarios each wrapped with <scenario> tags.
